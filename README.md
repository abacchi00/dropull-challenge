App created to complete [Dropull's Coding Challenge](https://dropull.notion.site/dropull/Software-Engineer-Challenge-fa62566881d24ccc9d3ea3c4f76fdd3c)

## ---> [Demo website](https://dropull-challenge-abacchi00.vercel.app/) <---

## :computer: ****Instructions on how to run the project****
- Install `yarn`
- Clone the project
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` and access `localhost:3000` to test the project
- Run `yarn test` to run tests

## :ballot_box_with_check: ****What was done****

### ****Acceptance Criteria (Must Have)****

- :heavy_check_mark: Use of React and Next.js
- :heavy_check_mark: Does it run as expected: Does the step-by-step required to run the application work?
- :heavy_check_mark: Code organization: Module separation and project organization
- :heavy_check_mark: Documentation of your process:
  - :heavy_check_mark: Instructions on how to run the project (e.g. README.md, DEVELOPERLOG.md)
  - :heavy_check_mark: What was done
  - :heavy_check_mark: What could be improved
- :heavy_check_mark: Pages must be fully responsive and mobile friendly
- :heavy_minus_sign: Unit tests - no need to achieve 100% coverage, but rather cover some components to showcase your test writing skills
<br/><span style="color: gray">Notes: I don't know if they are enough, but surely I would like to write more (and better) tests</span>
- :heavy_check_mark: Good markup, semantic HTML and SEO concerns
<br/><span style="color: gray">Notes: It is up to the evaluator if it has a good Markup and SEO concerns</span>

### ****Optional Criteria (Nice to Have)****

- :heavy_check_mark: Use of CSS-in-JS
<br/><span style="color: gray">Notes: with Emotion library</span>
- :heavy_check_mark: Use of TypeScript
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Use of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- :heavy_check_mark: Loading transitions between pages
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Accessibility concerns
- :heavy_check_mark: A demo website running on Vercel, Netlify or any other similar free platform
- :heavy_check_mark: It doesn't have to be pixel perfect but follow the layout
- :heavy_check_mark: Use theme with design tokens
<br/><span style="color: gray">Notes: Got to improve it but yes</span>
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Use a internationalization framework (e.g. [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/))

## :see_no_evil: ****What could be improved****
- Evaluate if using Next.js's server side props would be a better option to get data
- Add HEAD to app
- Add more unit tests
- Add more tokens to theme in order to standardize project's design
- Implement integration tests
- Configure test coverage
- Congigure CI and branch permissions (such as testing when mergin to main and blocking main merges that are not from PR's)
- Configure ESLint
- Add i18n (English and Portuguese)
- Check referrer in order to block accessing purchase page via url typing
- Better use of Next.js's Image component
- Better decoupling from project's mocks
